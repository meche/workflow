# 1. What was used?

## 1.1 Inspirations

my inspiration is based in some specific sites. I believe in a increase of workflow with time, more knowledge it's more results.

### 1.1.1 UX

In User experience my first preoccupation is with the process. I'm follow one guide (link to guide) what represent my base for developing of a application.

Let's go to the process!

1. Knowledge

First time, get the knowledge acquired whit the years and theoric methods of UX. I'm use:

- Guide of [PrinciWeb](http://www.princiweb.com.br/blog/design/usabilidade-ux/como-uma-avaliacao-heuristica-ajuda-a-melhorar-a-usabilidade-de-um-site.html) with base book A Project Guide to [UX Design: For User Experience Designers in the Field or in the Mark](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Guide-Design-Experience-Designers/dp/0321815386).
- I chose the [10 heuristics of Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to use on projects.


- [The 5 main ingredients of UX](http://thehipperelement.com/post/72080847673/daily-ux-crash-course-3-of-31) - *UX*, *Design*, *article*.
- [O Wireframe enquanto metodo não entregável](http://arquiteturadeinformacao.com/user-experience/o-wireframe-enquanto-metodo-nao-entregavel/) - *UX*, *Design*, *Wireframe*, *article*.
